										<h2>REFLECTIONS</h2>
									</header>
									<p><b>Unit 1</b><br>
										Participating in the discussion deepened my understanding of the critical role data cleaning and wrangling play in effective data analytics. I previously viewed data preparation as a routine technical step, but I now recognize it as a foundational process that directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of analytical insights. Real‑world datasets are rarely perfect, and issues such as missing values, duplicates, outliers, and noisy data are inevitable, particularly in IoT‑driven environments.
The discussion helped me appreciate that data cleaning is not a one‑time task but an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring as new data is generated. I also became more aware of the risks associated with handling sensitive data, including security breaches and data corruption. Overall, this reflection has reshaped my perspective on data wrangling as a strategic and essential component of trustworthy, data‑driven decision‑making, reinforcing the idea that high‑quality data is fundamental to meaningful insight and organizational success (Infragistics, 2013).<br>

		<b>Unit 3</b><br>			
		The web‑scraping exercise strengthened my understanding of how Python libraries such as Requests and BeautifulSoup support data retrieval and parsing through HTTP communication. I learned how web content can be extracted, processed, and converted into structured formats like JSON or XML for further use. The task also highlighted the importance of ethical scraping practices, including respecting access rules and handling errors appropriately. Overall, this activity demonstrated how web scraping forms a key foundation for data collection in analytics workflows.</p>
		<b>Unit 6</b><br>								
				Through the CDC Group Healthcare Database project, I learned the importance of robust database design in supporting efficient and secure healthcare operations. I gained insight into how logical data models and entity–relationship diagrams help maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy. The project strengthened my understanding of healthcare data standards such as ICD‑10 and LOINC, highlighting their role in interoperability across complex systems. I also learned how data quality processes, including validation and duplicate detection, are essential when managing large datasets. Overall, this experience enhanced my awareness of ethical, technical, and governance considerations in healthcare information systems (De Mello et al., 2022).<br>

<b>Unit 8</b><br>	
		This unit has deepened my understanding of how data protection legislation supports effective data governance and organisational accountability. By analysing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), I demonstrated knowledge of key legal requirements, particularly Articles 5(1)(f) and 32, which mandate appropriate technical and organisational safeguards to protect personal data (European Council, 2024). My discussion of ICO guidance further reflects an understanding of how regulatory frameworks translate into enforceable security outcomes. I applied comparative analysis by examining Trinidad and Tobago’s Data Protection Act, 2011 alongside the GDPR. While both frameworks adopt a risk‑based approach and require safeguards proportional to data sensitivity, I evaluated their differences in regulatory maturity and enforcement. Expanding my analysis to include South Africa’s POPIA and Mexico’s LFPDPPP allowed me to demonstrate broader awareness across jurisdictions. Reflecting on this learning, I conclude that achieving strong data protection outcomes depends on proactive governance, robust security practices, and clear organisational accountability rather than jurisdiction alone.<br>

									<b>Unit 10</b><br>
									Completing this assessment encouraged me to reflect more deeply on how APIs, while essential, can introduce serious security risks when fundamental controls are overlooked. Reviewing real‑world breaches challenged my assumption that major incidents always stem from complex attacks and highlighted how design decisions and complacency often play a greater role. This experience reinforced the importance of integrating security consciousness throughout the API lifecycle and maintaining a proactive, risk‑aware mindset.
